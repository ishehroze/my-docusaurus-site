### Objection regarding eitquette of mail

Mr. S.M. Asaduzzaman placed his objection on being addressed without proper
salutation from a particular MISL member. In another occasion, another MISL
member told him to learn the business for a particular topic first simply on
asking in which table the respective data is preserved. A.T.M. Anisur Rabbani
apologized and assured him that such any such incidents when conveyed will be
addressed.

### Undelivered items from Investment module

- Need to confirm if entire sanction delete item is covered in SoW
- EFTN report is same for C&C and CAD. Format from C&C already available. Need
  to deliver.
- Need to remove restriction from restructure related to back-date entry before
  advice date
- Showing sanction number field at account opening level. This is to be resolved
  as a CR item.
- Limit report issues:
  - Need to check of the production report is up-to-date
  - Deleted nodes showing up in limit report
  - Change labels according to mail from Hassan bhai
  - Utilization to be 0 for revolving nodes
- Issue regarding incorporating children total in Node-wise limit utilization
  register report (limit usages report) to be resolved as a CR item
- CBL will provide document related to Security Register Maintenance (SRM) to
  MISL for initiating development
- CBL will provide format for date range-wise recovery forecasting

### Report-related feedback

- **Customer Exposure back date fix** from Tuhin Shah Toyab to A.T.M. Anisur
  Rabbani
- Profit/rent realizable GL-related bug for closing payable report from Tuhin
  Shah Toyab to Shaikh Ahmed Farooqui
- All branch facility in reports
- Customer performance report format issue (adjusting font size so that column
  headers, amounts, etc. doesn't break)
- Addressing feedbacks related to reports from Tuhin Shah Toyab with mail
  subject **RE: Ababil Operational issue solution**

### Nazim bhai's observation

- Sub-GL selection difficult with the new lookup facility. For C&C users, the
  previous dropdown was more user-friendly and less error-prone
- C&C not launching auto closing due to Closing Report's unavailability
- Session timeout issue during operation
- Account statement report with duplicates for account number `1786310003282`
  - Address blank for the first part
  - Address okay for the next part
- Value date column should be filled for account statement. Currently, some are
  filled and some are blank.
- Back-date manual reverse transaction facility for EFTN transactions.

### Ali bhai's remarks on FCy limit, OD, and Branch-wise product restriction

- Foreign currency limit to be resolved as a CR item
- A meeting (possibly online) to be held on Monday, December 20, 2021 on the
  working principles of Islamic overdraft. However, a document is required from
  CBL in this regard.
- CBL prefers a role-rights based product availability restriction at
  branch/HO-level for investment module. MISL needs to show the existing (but
  hidden) facility on whether it would suffice.

### Delivery date for remaining items and setting release plan

MISL set December 22, 2021 as a deadline for providing delivery date for
remaining items. Meanwhile, S.M. Asaduzzman, Tuhin Shah Toyab, and Shaikh Ahmed
Farooqui will work on a release plan with proper priorities set for the
remaining items.

## Items not addressed

Proper clarification for back-date moratorium (mail from MISL with subject:
**Decision Required for Applying Moratorium Period from Back Date**) isn't
addressed yet
